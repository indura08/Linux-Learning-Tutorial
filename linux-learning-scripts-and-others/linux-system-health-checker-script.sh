	about free command

ðŸ§  What is the free command?
The free command in Linux shows you how much memory is available and used on your system â€” including RAM and swap space.

Think of it as a quick snapshot of your system's memory situation ðŸ§¾.

-h means human readable kiyna ekai

âž¤ -b: Batch mode
Normally, top runs interactively (keeps updating the screen).

With -b (batch mode), it runs just once and prints the output to the terminal.

Useful for scripts, because you donâ€™t want it to keep updating.

âž¤ -n 1: Number of iterations
This tells top how many times it should run before quitting.

-n 1 means: "Run just once, then exit."
