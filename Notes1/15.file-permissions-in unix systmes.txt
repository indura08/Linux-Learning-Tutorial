In Linux and UNIX, file permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory. Permissions help secure the system by restricting access, ensuring that only certain users or groups can perform certain actions on files.

Basic File Permissions
-----------------------

Each file and directory in Linux/UNIX has three types of permissions for three types of users:

1. User (Owner): The person who created the file or directory.
2. Group: A set of users that may also have access to the file.
3. Others (World): Anyone else with access to the system.

For each of these, three main permissions apply:
-----------------------------------------------

Read (r): Allows reading or viewing the file’s contents.
Write (w): Allows modifying the file.
Execute (x): Allows running the file as a program or script.


example:

for this kind of output for ls -l command

-rwxr-xr--

This string is broken down as follows:

First character (-): Indicates the file type (e.g., - for a regular file, d for directory).

	Next three characters (rwx): Permissions for the owner (user).
	Next three characters (r-x): Permissions for the group.	
	Last three characters (r--): Permissions for others.

In above example:

The owner can read, write, and execute.
The group can read and execute but not write.
Others can only read.



Changing Permissions
---------------------
The chmod command is used to change file permissions. You can set permissions using either symbolic (letters) or numeric (octal) representations.

1. Symbolic Mode
================

Use letters to specify which permission to add (+), remove (-), or set (=).

	chmod u+x filename   # Adds execute permission for the user
	
	chmod g-w filename   # Removes write permission for the group
	
	chmod o=r filename   # Sets read-only permission for others



2. Numeric (Octal) Mode
=======================

Each permission has a numeric value:

Read = 4
Write = 2
Execute = 1

Permissions are represented as a three-digit number:

First digit: User permissions
Second digit: Group permissions
Third digit: Others’ permissions

example commands :

1. chmod 755 myscript.sh   # Sets permissions to rwxr-xr-x (user can do everything; group and others can read and execute)

2. chmod u+r,g+w,o= filename   # Adds read for user, write for group, and sets read-only for others


in here 7 means that 4+2+1 , so user can do read right execute
