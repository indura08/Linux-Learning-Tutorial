sed (Stream Editor) is a command in Bash used to find, replace, delete, and manipulate text in files or strings. Itâ€™s especially handy for quick text edits directly from the command line without opening a text editor.

Basic syntax

sed 'command' filename


1. Basic Find and Replace
--------------------------

Example: Replacing a Word

echo "Hello World" | sed 's/World/Bash/'

output: Hello Bash

	s/old/new/: s stands for "substitute," followed by old (text to replace) and new (replacement text).
	
	This replaces the first occurrence of "World" with "Bash" in each line.

example : echo "Hello World World" | sed 's/World/Bash/g'

output: Hello Bash Bash 


2. Modifying a File (In-Place Editing)
---------------------------------------

With -i, you can make edits directly to a file.

sed -i 's/old_text/new_text/g' filename.txt

	-i modifies the file directly.
	
	This replaces old_text with new_text everywhere in filename.txt.


3. Deleting Lines
==================

You can use sed to delete specific lines.

Example: Deleting a Specific Line by Number

sed '2d' filename.txt

	2d: Deletes line 2 in filename.txt.

Example: Deleting Lines Matching a Pattern

sed '/pattern/d' filename.txt

/pattern/d: Deletes lines containing "pattern".

4. Selecting and Printing Specific Lines
------------------------------------------

You can use sed to print specific lines without modifying the file.

sed -n '2p' filename.txt

-n: Suppresses automatic printing.
2p: Prints only line 2.

5. Inserting or Appending Text
-----------------------------------

To insert text before a line, use i.
To append text after a line, use a.


sed '2i\Inserted Text' filename.txt

2i\text: Inserts "Inserted Text" before line 2.


example: sed '2a\Appended Text' filename.txt


2a\text: Appends "Appended Text" after line 2.

command :sed 's/fly/grasshopper/g' sedTest.txt

The output:

The grasshopper flies like no grasshopper flies
A grasshopper is an insect that has wings and a grasshopper likes to eat leftovers


in the code g means that we want to do this sed globally which means i want to perform this task to whole text file
