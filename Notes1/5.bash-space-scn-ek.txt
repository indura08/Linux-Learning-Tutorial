Why No Spaces?

Bash interprets spaces as delimiters between commands and arguments.
If you put a space before or after the = sign, bash thinks you're trying to run a command (FIRST_NAME) with the arguments (= and indura), and it doesnâ€™t know what to do with them.

The correct way to assign a value to a variable in bash is: " FIRST_NAME=indura "
