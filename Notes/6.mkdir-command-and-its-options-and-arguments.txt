📁 What is mkdir?
------------------

mkdir stands for make directory — it’s the command you use to create folders (directories) in Linux.

🧪 Basic Usage
===============

mkdir foldername

🔹 This creates a folder named foldername in your current directory.


🛠️ Commonly Used Options / Flags
===================================

Option		Full Option		What It Does
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-p		--parents	Creates parent directories if needed, and won’t throw error if folder already exists
-v		--verbose	Shows a message every time a folder is created
-m		--mode=MODE	Set permissions (like 755, 777) when creating the folder


✅ -p — Create Parents
========================

Imagine you want to create this path:

myfolder/inside/another/deepfolder

If you just type:

mkdir myfolder/inside/another/deepfolder

You'll get an error if myfolder or any part of the path doesn't exist.

But with -p:

mkdir -p myfolder/inside/another/deepfolder

🔹 It creates everything in the path if it’s not there!


✅ -m — Set Permissions
========================

Permissions like 777 (full access) or 755 (owner access) when making folders.

mkdir -m 755 securefolder

This creates securefolder with permission rwxr-xr-x.





example instance :

lets say there is a path called 
test/folder1/folder2/folder3

if we were to write this command:

	" rm -rf test/*/ "
	
test folder eka arunama anik okkoma delete wela ynwa
