💡 What is sudo?
==================

sudo means "Super User DO".

It lets you do things as the system admin (the boss).

Ubuntu doesn’t let normal users do powerful system changes. So when you use sudo, you're saying:
👉 “Hey Linux, let me do something important. I promise I know what I’m doing.” 😅

Example:

sudo apt install vlc

Here, you're saying:

"Run the command to install VLC as an admin (because installing software needs special permission)."

💡 What is apt?
-----------------

apt stands for Advanced Package Tool.

It’s like the app store command in Ubuntu.

Think of it like this:

apt helps you install, update, and remove software.

It talks to online software warehouses (called repositories) to get what you need.

Common apt commands:

Command					What it does
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

apt install <package>			Installs software
apt remove <package>			Uninstalls software
apt update				Updates the list of available software
apt upgrade				Upgrades installed software to latest version

🔧 Full Example: Installing VLC Media Player
---------------------------------------------------

sudo apt update          # Updates the list of available software
sudo apt install vlc     # Installs VLC media player

First, we update so apt knows the latest versions of apps.

Then, we install the software we want.


Q:

so this apt pakcage manager is available for all linux distributions like kali linux, hanthana linux, ubuntu etc?

A:

✅ apt is available on some, but not all Linux distributions.

apt is a package manager that comes from the Debian family of Linux distributions. So it's only used by Debian-based systems.

🐧 Distributions that DO use apt:
-----------------------------------

Ubuntu (and all its flavors like Kubuntu, Xubuntu)

Kali Linux

Linux Mint

Pop!_OS

Debian itself

✅ These use .deb packages and apt to install/update/remove software.

🐧 Distributions that DO NOT use apt:
-----------------------------------------

They use different package managers, like:

Distro					Package Manager			File Type
===========================================================================================
Fedora					dnf or yum			.rpm
Arch Linux				pacman				.pkg.tar.zst
Manjaro					pacman				.pkg.tar.zst
openSUSE				zypper				.rpm
Hanthana Linux (based on Fedora)	dnf				.rpm


💡 So if you're using:
Ubuntu or Kali Linux → You can use apt ✅

Hanthana Linux (based on Fedora) → You use dnf or yum ❌ apt won’t work natively.
