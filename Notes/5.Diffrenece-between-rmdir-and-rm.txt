🗂️ rmdir vs rm — What’s the Difference?
---------------------------------------

🧹 rmdir – Remove Directory
============================

Only removes empty folders.

Think of it like trying to delete an empty drawer.

If the folder has files or other folders, it says: "Nope, not gonna do it!"

📦 Example:

	"rmdir myfolder"
	

→ Removes myfolder only if it's empty.

💣 rm – Remove Files or Folders
=================================

Removes files, folders, anything.

It's powerful and a bit dangerous if you’re not careful.

Can remove non-empty folders with the right options.

Example: 

	"rm myfile.txt"

→ Deletes a file.

	"rm -r myfolder"
	
→ Deletes a folder and everything inside.
