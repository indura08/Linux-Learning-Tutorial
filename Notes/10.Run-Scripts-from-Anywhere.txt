üßê What does ‚ÄúRun scripts from anywhere‚Äù mean?
----------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs say you made a script called hello.sh.
By default, to run it, you have to be in the folder where that script is, like this:

cd ~/scripts
./hello.sh

But what if you're in another folder like Downloads or Documents and you still want to run hello.sh without typing the full path?

Like this:

hello.sh

That‚Äôs what ‚Äúrun scripts from anywhere‚Äù means ‚Äî being able to run your script from any folder without giving its full path.

üß© How do we make that work?
-----------------------------

We need to do two things:

‚úÖ 1. Move your script to a directory that‚Äôs in your $PATH

Linux has a list of folders where it looks for programs/commands (like ls, cd, etc). This list is stored in an environment variable called PATH.

To see your current PATH folders, run:

echo $PATH

You‚Äôll see something like:

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/home/yourname/bin

If you place your script in one of these folders (e.g. /usr/local/bin or ~/bin), then Linux will know where to find it.

‚úÖ Example:

1. First, give your script execute permission:

chmod +x hello.sh


2. Then move it to a PATH folder:

sudo mv hello.sh /usr/local/bin/


Now, from any folder, you can just type:

hello.sh

and it runs

üõ†Ô∏è Bonus: Add your own folder to PATH
-----------------------------------------

If you want to keep your scripts in your own folder (like ~/my-scripts), you can add that folder to your PATH.

1. Open your .bashrc file:

nano ~/.bashrc

2. Add this line to the bottom:

export PATH="$HOME/my-scripts:$PATH"

3. Save and exit (Ctrl + O, then Enter, then Ctrl + X)

4. Reload it:

source ~/.bashrc

Now, any script inside ~/my-scripts will run from anywhere too!
