Input and Output Redirection in BashIn bash, input and output redirection allows you to control how data flows in and out of commands or programs. You can send the output of a command to a file or make a command read its input from a file instead of the keyboard. Here's a simpler breakdown of how it works:1. Output Redirection (> and >>)================================>: Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.>>: Redirects the output to a file, but appends to the file if it already exists (doesn't overwrite).Example:* > (Overwrite):	echo "Hello, world!" > output.txtThis writes "Hello, world!" to output.txt. If the file already exists, it will overwrite the content.* >> (Append):	echo "Another line" >> output.txtecho "Another line" >> output.txt2. Input Redirection (<)========================<: Redirects input from a file instead of the keyboard (standard input).	cat < input.txtThis makes the cat command read from input.txt rather than waiting for you to type something. It will print the contents of input.txt to the terminal.example 2 : mn krpu eka	" wc -w < redirection.sh " +. mekan wenne redirection.sh file eke word count ek ganina eka  3. Combining Input and Output Redirection=========================================You can use both input and output redirection in the same command.	sort < input.txt > sorted_output.txtThis reads data from input.txt, sorts it, and writes the sorted data to sorted_output.txt. If sorted_output.txt exists, it will be overwritten.4. Standard Error Redirection (2>, 2>>)========================================In addition to standard output (which is redirected with > and >>), you can also redirect standard error (the error messages a command produces).	2>: Redirects error output to a file (overwrites the file).	2>>: Appends error output to a file.command_that_might_fail 2> errors.txtThis runs command_that_might_fail and sends any error messages to errors.txt.5. Redirecting Both Output and Error (&>)==========================================You can redirect both the output and error to the same file using &>.Example:command &> output_and_errors.txt6. Piping (|)==============While not exactly redirection, piping is another way to control the flow of data between commands. It lets you take the output of one command and use it as input for another.Example:cat file.txt | grep "keyword"This takes the output of cat file.txt (which displays the file content) and pipes it into grep, which searches for the word "keyword" in the file.
