The cat command in Linux (and Unix-like systems, including WSL) is one of the most frequently used commands. It's short for "concatenate" and is primarily used to read, display, and concatenate files. Here's a breakdown of what cat can do:

Basic sytax :

cat [options] [file...]

1. Reading and Displaying the Contents of a File

	cat filename.txt

2. Displaying Multiple Files

	cat file1.txt file2.txt

3. Creating a New File

	cat > newfile.txt

4. Appending to a File

	cat >> existingfile.txt

5. Using with Pipes (|)

	cat file.txt | grep "search_term"

6. Numbering Lines in a File - If you want to see line numbers in a file when displaying its content, use the -n option:

	cat -n file.txt

7. Suppressing Blank Lines

	cat -s file.txt

8. Copying Contents from One File to Another

	cat file1.txt > file2.txt

	If you want to append instead of overwrite:

	cat file1.txt >> file2.txt
