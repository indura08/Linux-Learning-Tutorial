shebang
--------

shebang is a most important thing because it will point out what is the interpreter we should use for a particular script. but in bash when we dont specify shebang we cant run that bash script using the command: 

	" ./bashscriptName.sh "
	
instead we need to use commands like:

	" sh bashscriptName.sh"
	
	or
	
	"bash bashScriptName.sh"
